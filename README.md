# Hosted-Full-Stack-Appointment-Booking-App--Django-AWS
This is a fully functional Appointment Booking App built with Django (Python) and deployed using AWS services like EC2 and RDS.
It allows professionals (like doctors, teachers, consultants, etc.) to:
‚Ä¢	Create available time slots
‚Ä¢	Let users book appointments
‚Ä¢	Manage bookings and data securely
The goal of this project was to take a real-world app, set it up on the cloud, and make it work just like a professional system would.

‚úÖ What I Did (In Simple Steps)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Built the App with Django
I started by building the backend using Django, which handles:
‚Ä¢	Time slots
‚Ä¢	Booking system
‚Ä¢	Admin management
‚Ä¢	Database models
Everything was tested locally first to make sure the logic and database are working correctly.
________________________________________
2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up AWS EC2 (Virtual Machine)
I launched an EC2 instance (Amazon‚Äôs cloud computer) to host the project.
‚Ä¢	Installed Linux, Python, pip, PostgreSQL client, Git
‚Ä¢	Uploaded the project code securely using SCP
‚Ä¢	Set up a virtual environment and installed all requirements
‚Ä¢	Ran the app using python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
Now the app is live and can be accessed via the EC2 public IP.
________________________________________
3Ô∏è‚É£ Connected to RDS (Cloud Database)
Instead of using a local database, I used Amazon RDS to store booking data securely.
‚Ä¢	Created a PostgreSQL DB instance on RDS
‚Ä¢	Connected the Django app to this DB using credentials and endpoint
‚Ä¢	Now all appointments, time slots, and data are saved directly to RDS
________________________________________
4Ô∏è‚É£ Deployed and Tested Everything Live
Once the code and DB were connected:
‚Ä¢	I created a time slot using the Django admin panel
‚Ä¢	Then, I tested booking that slot from the frontend/API
‚Ä¢	Finally, I checked that the data was saved in RDS ‚Äî success! ‚úÖ

üéØ What This Project Proves
This is not just a coding project ‚Äî it's a complete cloud deployment case study that shows I can:
‚Ä¢	Build real backend systems
‚Ä¢	Deploy apps securely on EC2
‚Ä¢	Set up and connect cloud databases (RDS)
‚Ä¢	Work with environments, dependencies, SSH, and server management
‚Ä¢	Ensure real-time data flows between frontend, backend, and cloud DB
________________________________________
üí° Use Cases
This setup can be used for:
‚Ä¢	Appointment apps (doctors, tutors, coaches)
‚Ä¢	Booking systems (classes, meetings, events)
‚Ä¢	Any service-based platform that needs time slot booking
